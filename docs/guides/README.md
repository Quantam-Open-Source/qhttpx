## 🔍 Learning from Examples

The best way to learn is often by reading code. We have a comprehensive set of examples and a sample application available in the repository:

### 📂 [Examples Folder](../../examples/)
Contains focused, runnable scripts for specific features:
- **Routing & Middleware**: `hello.ts`, `demo.ts`, `middleware_demo.ts`
- **Real-time**: `ws_demo.ts`
- **Security**: `tls_demo.ts`, `cors_demo.ts`, `db_auth_demo.ts`
- **Performance**: `cluster_demo.ts`, `http2_demo.ts`
- **Data**: `mongo_demo.ts`, `db_auth_demo.ts`, `upload_demo.ts`

### 📱 [Sample App](../../sample-app/)
A complete, production-ready application demonstrating how to structure a real-world QHTTPX project. It includes:
- Modular architecture
- Database integration
- Authentication flows
- Frontend integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you are new to QHTTPX, we recommend starting with the **Core Features** guide to understand the basic building blocks of the framework.
