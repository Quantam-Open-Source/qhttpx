# Security Policy

## Project Status: Pre-Release

QHTTPX is currently in **active development and has not yet been officially released**.
As such, there are no "supported versions" in the traditional sense. We are actively iterating on the `main` branch.

**Please treat all code as experimental.**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of QHTTPX seriously, even in this early stage. If you discover a security vulnerability in the current codebase, please do not disclose it publicly until we have had a chance to fix it.

### Process

1.  **Do NOT** open a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
2.  Email us at **security@quantam.com**.
3.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability and a reproduction case if possible.
4.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
5.  We will provide an estimated timeline for the fix.
6.  Once fixed, we will issue a security advisory and credit you for the discovery (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

### Bug Bounty

We do not currently have a paid bug bounty program, but we are happy to send swag or provide public recognition for significant security findings.
