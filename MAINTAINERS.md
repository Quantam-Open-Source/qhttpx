## Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainership is earned through continued contribution and trust-building within the community. We generally look for:
- Consistent contributions (code, docs, issue triage).
- Deep understanding of the codebase (both TypeScript and Rust layers).
- Adherence to the Code of Conduct.
- Active participation in discussions.
